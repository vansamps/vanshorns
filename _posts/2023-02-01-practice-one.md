Hello everyone; today I wanted to start a rolling blog post to cover all the incredibly varied terminology that you'll come across as you learn to play the guitar, both acoustic and electric.

This glossary is going to be a continuously updated blog post that will provide as many technically accurate definitions for all the differnt terms you'll come across as you learn to play. I hope that many players, new and old, will be able to come to this post and use the information to help clarify some of the misconceptions, miscommunications, and plain old misinformation that is spread throughout the internet and by word of mouth.

In my own experience, guitar players and musicians in general speak in a very contextual language that relies very heavily on experience to understand what one another is saying. This can make it extremely difficult for new players to learn, and it also makes it hard for veterans and intermediate players to undertand eachother when everyone has a different definition for the same thing. I am going to do everything in my power to provide accurate, technical descriptions for all the terms included in the glossary, to avoid as many of the problems that I talked about above. Without further ado, let's actually start talking about some of the terms you'll come across as you dive into the guitar world.
