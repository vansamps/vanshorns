Making the amplifier

I originally intended to have the making of the amplifier be a small section of this piece but after drafting it out I realized I had too much to say and would rather make it its own post

At the end of the day, music is about connection and communicating the different parts of what it means to be human and what life is and is like.

You reap what you sow, then you sow again, and so on and so forth

Fill your bowl cup by cup, then empty it so you can fill it again.

Always look through the eyes of the novice

Hello everyone, my name is Evan and I have very happily been working on this website for the last two years without having any real plan for what it was going to look like as a finished project. That's not necessarily true, I did have a vision for the website with each revision that I made to it, but with each revision more and more of the purpose of the website got lost along the way. Before I knew it, I had no idea what I was trying to do with this website or why I was doing it in the first place. 

## Making The Amplifier

I don't want to look too deeply into the amplifier in this part of the website because it truly deserves it's own deep dive in the future. The amplifier is a '65 Princeton Reverb with a few key modifications that at first seem incredibly simple, but shift the characterist of the amplifier into an entirely new direction that breathes life into her.
